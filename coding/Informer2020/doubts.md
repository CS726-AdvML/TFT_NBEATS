# Doubts

- What does number of encoder layers = 2 mean? args.e_layers?
- What is meaning of number of stack encoder layers? args.s_layers?
- What is this mix argument in Attention Layer class? Also at line = 60 model.py.
- What is d_ff in Encoder layer? They are doing some FCN there. Just showed it as Conv but it is 1 \* 1 kernel. So ..
- Reading Decoder in model.py is pending.
- Didn't get what this function = time_features_from_frequency_str(freq_str: str) -> List[TimeFeature]: is doing.
